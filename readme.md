# Objective
Repository for data, and the codes and algorithms used in the IPBES (www.ipbes.net) global assessment. These resources will be indexed and made available on the IPBES assessment repository on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/communities/ipbes). 

The overall scope of the IPBES global assessment is to assess the status and trends with regard to biodiversity and ecosystem services, the impact of biodiversity and ecosystem services on human well-being and the effectiveness of responses, including the Strategic Plan and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets. It is anticipated that this deliverable will contribute to the process for the evaluation and renewal of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets.
